- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging and transaction management.
- **Spring MVC**: Build web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplify Spring application development with a convention-over-configuration approach.
- **Spring Data**: Simplifies database interactions and provides powerful repositories.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization capabilities for your applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language.
- **Spring Framework**: Core framework for enterprise Java development.
- **Maven/Gradle**: Build automation tools (choose one).
- **JUnit**: Unit testing framework.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework to simplify Spring application setup and configuration.
